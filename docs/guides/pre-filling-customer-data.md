# Pre-filling the Customer's Data

When you share a Pay Link with customers, you can improve their experience by pre-filling their name or email, eliminating the need for them to re-enter information you already have. This can be achieved by adding this information as query parameters of the pay link. The example link below shows you how to pre-fill both name and email:

```
<PAYLINK-URL>?name=Tamara&email=tamara@gmail.com
```
