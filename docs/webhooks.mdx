# Webhooks

Webhooks are a way for our system to send real-time notifications to your application when certain events occur. By setting up webhooks, you can automate actions and keep your application in sync with our platform. For example, you can use webhooks to receive notifications when a payment is created or updated, allowing you to update your records or trigger other processes in response to these events.

    To set your default webhook URL, please contact our support team with the endpoint you would like to receive the webhook events.
