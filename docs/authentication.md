# Authentication

Uqualify's API employs an API Key security schema to authenticate all HTTP requests. These keys are unique alphanumeric tokens generated by Uqualify, serving as a digital "key" that grants authorized access to specific API endpoints. This ensures that only approved users or systems can request and retrieve data from the API.

The API Key is a critical element in our business operations, providing a secure and efficient way to access and utilize data, services, or resources offered by our application programming interface (API). In Uqualify, we use the x-api-method to protect information. This means you must include the x-api-key on the headers of each request. The following provides an example of how this should be done:

```curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://paylinks.uqualify.co.uk/api/v1/paylinks \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

:::warning

    ðŸš§ Keep your keys safe

    It is important to avoid sharing your secret API keys in public places like Github or Bitbucket since it can allow malicious API calls.
